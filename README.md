# US State SVG defs

The repo includes a few handy things:

+ A single state-svg-defs.svg file, providing easy access to all icons in one simple file.
+ SVG directory with individual SVG icons. (SVG defs approach recommended, but you could also include files individually).
+ demo.html showing svgdefs implementation.


## Credit
The original icons were [designed by ProPublica](https://github.com/propublica/stateface) and provided as an icon font.
I simply converted them to the (more modern) SVG defs format.
Huge thanks to ProPublica for the original work!
